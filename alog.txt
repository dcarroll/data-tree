Case 1: Object has childRefs
    Need to query the referenced child to get the ids for the parent that will allow
    us to get the right parents when needed.

    Query for children 'Select {$childRef.field} From {$childRef.childSobject} limit 10'
    
    Put the returned ids into an array {$ids}

    We can now query the parent using 'Select * From {$Parent} Where Id in {$ids}'
